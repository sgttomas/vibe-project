# Continuous Improvement Plan — Vibe Project

Intent / Steps / Outputs / Acceptance / Evidence / Correspondence
- Intent: Define a lightweight, continuous process to keep docs, benchmarks, and guides current and aligned with environment standards.
- Steps: Measure → identify gaps → plan small changes → implement → validate → record sync outcome.
- Outputs: Updated docs (AGENT guides, manifests), benchmark notes, sync entries, mini retrospectives.
- Acceptance: Doc-health PASS/WARN only; missing critical files resolved; links valid; sync notes updated with date and scope.
- Evidence: Doc-health output, benchmark JSONs under `rapid-clean/benchmark/results/`, SYNC-NOTES entries.
- Correspondence: Mirrors ↔ canonicals ↔ consumers (framework/app/orchestrator).

## Triggers
- New benchmark results or methodology changes
- Missing or stale AGENT/manifest/process docs detected by doc-health
- Mirror/canonical drift noted by status/mirrors

## Cadence
- Weekly 30-minute review or after notable sessions

## Procedure
1) Run `make status/mirrors` and `make doc/health PROJECT=projects/vibe-project`
2) Triage WARN/FAIL, prioritize fixes with smallest viable change
3) Implement and validate (links, acceptance blocks, artifacts)
4) Capture a dated bullet in `projects/ai-env/SYNC-NOTES.md`
5) Upstream to canonical repos if applicable; note consumers
