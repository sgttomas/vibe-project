# Generic Nomenclature (Vibe Project)

Purpose: This projectâ€™s documentation is generic so it can be instantiated for any concrete stack. Use these terms instead of product-specific names.

Standard terms
- AI Orchestrator: production orchestration/desktop wrapper and ops glue
- Frontend App: frontend/chat UI with document generation
- Backend Framework: backend semantic engine and services
- Chat Interface: generic chat front-end (when referring to UI only)
- App Core: document generation core within the app

Repository placeholders
- orchestrator: formerly `chirality-ai`
- ai-app: formerly `chirality-ai-app` (maps to Frontend App)
- framework: formerly `chirality-semantic-framework` (maps to Backend Framework)

Notes
- Keep URLs and historical file names intact when they refer to external repos or artifacts; adjust link text to generic names.
- Do not rename code identifiers in example snippets unless the target repo uses generic identifiers.
- When instantiating this project for a specific stack, replace these generic terms with your product names consistently.
