# Claude App Setup Guide

**For: Future Claude updating documentation improvement cycle in app**  
**Purpose: Maintain and evolve the continuous improvement system in the TypeScript app project**  
**Session 3 Validated**: Systematic AI-human collaboration methodology enabling breakthrough performance results

## Context

You're working with the documentation improvement system in `app` that needs periodic updates. This is one half of the system:
- **app**: TypeScript document generation with Neo4j (this project)
- **framework**: Python CF14 semantic operations (sister project)

## Current State

The app project already has a working continuous improvement system. Your job is to maintain and evolve it based on new developments.

## Step 1: Navigate to the App Project

```bash
cd /Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/vibe-project/app/
```

## Step 2: Review Existing Documentation System

### Core Files Already in Place
1. **CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - The ongoing process framework
2. **CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - May exist from previous cycle
3. **KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md** - Tracking document for all documentation
4. **AGENT.md** - AI collaboration guide (in project root)
5. **AGENT_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md** - In project root (`projects/vibe-project/`)

### Knowledge Transfer Pipeline
Located in `app/lib/framework/` containing:
1. 4_DOCUMENTS_ANALYSIS.md
2. API.md
3. CHANGELOG.md
4. AGENT.md
5. COMMIT_HOOKS.md
6. CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
7. CONTRIBUTING.md
8. CURRENT_STATUS.md
9. GRAPHQL_NEO4J_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
10. INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
11. KEY_DECISIONS.md
12. LICENSE
13. NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md
14. PROJECT_DIRECTORY.md
15. README.md
16. RELEASE_NOTES_14.3.0.md
17. VERSION.md
18. cf14_execution_trace.json
19. cf14_integration_example.py
20. component_viewer.py
21. requirements.txt
22. semantic_component_tracker.py
23. semantic_components.json
24. setup.py

## Step 3: Check for Updates Needed

### Review Triggers (Session 3 Enhanced)
Look for these signs that updates are needed:
- Git commits with documentation flags (MAJOR_OVERHAUL, STANDARD_UPDATE)
- New features added to the app
- User feedback about documentation issues
- Quarterly review cycle due
- Integration changes with framework
- **Session 3 Learning**: Accumulated complexity (P3-style artifacts) requiring clean baseline approach
- **Performance validation needs**: Benchmark results requiring documentation updates

### Version and Release Coordination
- Check if app version has changed in package.json
- Review if new releases were published
- Verify if framework version changed (affects integration docs)

## Step 4: Update Process

### If Triggered by Git Commit

1. **Check for CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md**
   - If it exists, this is the previous cycle's implementation plan
   - Review what was completed vs what's still pending

2. **Transform Plans if Needed**
   - If major overhaul triggered, create new CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
   - Use CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md as the template
   - Apply Matrix A (current state) Ã— Matrix B (methodology) approach

3. **Execute Updates**
   - Follow the phased approach in the plan
   - Update KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md status as you go
   - Maintain reasoning traces

### Regular Maintenance Updates (Session 3 Enhanced)

1. **Update KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md**
   ```markdown
   - Change statuses: ðŸ”„ NEEDS_UPDATE â†’ ðŸ†• UPDATED â†’ âœ… CURRENT
   - Add new files that were created
   - Mark deprecated files
   - Apply Session 3 principles: clean baseline + elegant solutions
   ```

2. **Synchronize Mirror Documentation**
   - Check if `/lib/framework/` needs updates
   - Particularly AGENT.md in that directory
   - Ensure version numbers match current framework release

3. **Update Integration Documentation**
   - INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md for any Neo4j changes
   - API.md for new endpoints or GraphQL schema changes
   - NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md for CF14 integration updates

## Step 5: TypeScript/App Specific Considerations

### Frontend Documentation
Located in `app/docs/` directory:
- FRONTEND_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
- UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- Component documentation in `/docs/components/`
- ADRs in `/docs/adr/frontend/`

### Key App-Specific Updates
- **Streaming/SSE**: Document any changes to real-time features
- **Chat Interface**: Update chat component documentation
- **Document Generation**: Two-pass generation flow changes
- **RAG System**: Updates to retrieval-augmented generation

### Package Management
- Keep package.json version synchronized with documentation
- Update RELEASE_NOTES_v*.md for new versions
- Coordinate with PyPI releases of framework

## Step 6: Coordination with Framework

### Check Framework Mirror
The framework has its own mirror at:
`framework/lib/app/`

That directory should contain these 27 files:
1. API.md
2. ARCHITECTURE.md
3. CHANGELOG.md
4. AGENT.md
5. COMMIT_HOOKS.md
6. CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
7. CONTRIBUTING.md
8. CURRENT_STATUS.md
9. GRAPHQL_NEO4J_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
10. HELP.md
11. INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
12. KEY_DECISIONS.md
13. KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md
14. KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER_MANIFEST.md
15. LICENSE
16. MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
17. NEO4J_SEMANTIC_INTEGRATION.md
18. ONBOARDING.md
19. PROJECT_DIRECTORY.md
20. README.md
21. RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md
22. TROUBLESHOOTING.md
23. VERSION.md
24. package-lock.json
25. package.json
26. requirements.txt
27. tsconfig.json

**Important**: When you make significant updates to app documentation, consider if the framework mirror needs updating too.

## Step 7: Implementation Checklist

## Success Criteria (Session 3 Validated)

You know the update is successful when:
- All documentation accurately reflects current implementation (Session 3: competitive performance achieved)
- KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md shows appropriate status for all docs
- Code examples work when tested (Session 3: all tests pass)
- Internal links are functional
- Version numbers are consistent
- Integration documentation matches both projects
- **Session 3 Standards**: Documentation supports elegant solutions and breakthrough results
- **AI Collaboration Quality**: Future Claude instances can achieve similar systematic success
