# Git Commit Hooks for CF14 Documentation Review Cycle

*Systematic integration of documentation improvements with git workflow*

## Purpose

This document establishes the trigger mechanism for CF14 documentation review cycles through git commit workflow integration. It ensures that significant changes automatically initiate systematic documentation updates following CF14 methodology.

## Commit Trigger Classification

### Documentation Review Triggers

**Major Documentation Overhaul Required:**
- Feature additions affecting user-facing APIs
- Architectural changes impacting system design
- New capability implementations
- Research findings requiring claim updates
- User feedback indicating systematic documentation issues

**Standard Documentation Updates:**
- Bug fixes with user impact
- Configuration changes
- Minor feature enhancements
- Routine maintenance updates

**No Documentation Review:**
- Internal refactoring without external impact
- Test-only changes
- Development environment updates

## Pre-Commit Documentation Assessment

### Commit Message Analysis Framework

When preparing commits that may trigger documentation review, include this analysis in the commit message:

```
[STANDARD COMMIT MESSAGE]

--- CF14 DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT ---
Trigger Level: [MAJOR_OVERHAUL | STANDARD_UPDATE | NO_REVIEW]
Affected Documentation Categories:
- [ ] Primary User Documents (README, API, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- [ ] Technical Reference (ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING)  
- [ ] Assessment Documents (SPECULATIVE_CLAIMS)
- [ ] Project Management (STATUS, ROADMAP, DECISIONS)

Impact Analysis:
- User Experience Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NONE]
- Technical Accuracy Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NONE]
- Capability Claims Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NONE]

Methodology Recommendation: [4_DOCUMENTS | USER_JOURNEY | EVIDENCE_UPDATE | CONSISTENCY_AUDIT]

Estimated Documentation Scope: [1-3 documents | 4-6 documents | 7+ documents | Full suite]
```

## Documentation Review Cycle Trigger Process

### Step 1: Commit Message Analysis
```bash
# Extract documentation assessment from commit message
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%B" | grep -A 20 "CF14 DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT"
```

### Step 2: Generate CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN
If trigger level indicates documentation review needed:

1. **Extract Matrix A (Current State)**: Parse commit changes and impact analysis
2. **Define Matrix B (Methodology)**: Select appropriate improvement approach based on recommendation
3. **Generate Requirements**: Apply CF14 semantic multiplication to create specific improvement requirements
4. **Create Implementation Plan**: Convert CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN â†’ CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN with:
   - Specific phases based on affected documentation categories
   - Timeline based on estimated scope
   - Success criteria based on impact analysis

### Step 3: Execute Documentation Review Cycle
Follow the generated CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN:
- Update affected documents systematically
- Track status through KEY_PROJECT_FILES.md
- Maintain complete reasoning trace
- Validate improvements against success criteria

### Step 4: Commit Message Revision
After documentation review cycle completion, create amended commit with updated message:

```
[ORIGINAL COMMIT MESSAGE]

--- CF14 DOCUMENTATION REVIEW COMPLETED ---
Review Cycle: [Date] - [CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN reference]
Documents Updated: [List of files with status changes]
Methodology Applied: [4_DOCUMENTS | USER_JOURNEY | etc.]
Phases Completed: [List of completed phases]
Validation Results: [Success criteria met]

Documentation Status Post-Review:
âœ… UPDATED: [List of newly updated documents]
âœ… CURRENT: [List of validated current documents]  
ðŸ“‹ PLANNED: [List of future improvements identified]

Reasoning Trace: [Reference to complete audit trail]
Next Review Trigger: [Conditions for next documentation cycle]
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers Making Commits

#### Before Committing
1. **Assess Documentation Impact**: Review changes against trigger classification
2. **Include CF14 Assessment**: Add documentation assessment section to commit message
3. **Flag for Review**: Use appropriate trigger level classification

#### When Documentation Review Triggered
1. **Pause Development**: Allow documentation review cycle to complete
2. **Provide Context**: Clarify technical details for documentation updates
3. **Validate Results**: Review updated documentation for accuracy

### For Documentation Maintainers

#### Monitoring Commits
1. **Review Commit Messages**: Check for CF14 documentation assessments
2. **Triage by Trigger Level**: Prioritize major overhauls over standard updates
3. **Track Review Cycles**: Maintain documentation of all triggered reviews

#### Executing Reviews
1. **Generate Consolidated Plan**: Follow systematic CF14 methodology
2. **Execute Systematically**: Implement improvements according to generated plan
3. **Update Commit History**: Amend commits with review completion details

## Automation Opportunities

### Git Hooks Integration
```bash
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
# Auto-prompt for CF14 documentation assessment

# .git/hooks/post-commit  
# Check for documentation review triggers and notify maintainers

# .git/hooks/pre-push
# Verify documentation review completion for flagged commits
```

### Tooling Integration
- **Commit message templates** for CF14 assessment inclusion
- **Automated documentation impact analysis** based on file changes
- **Review cycle status tracking** integrated with project management tools

## Quality Assurance

### Review Cycle Validation
- [ ] All triggered reviews follow CF14 systematic methodology
- [ ] Complete reasoning traces maintained for each cycle
- [ ] Commit messages accurately reflect documentation changes
- [ ] Status tracking remains consistent across all documents

### Process Improvement
- **Cycle Metrics**: Track time from trigger to completion
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure documentation improvement effectiveness  
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate lessons learned into process refinement

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Relationship to Other Documents
- **CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN**: Provides ongoing process framework
- **CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN**: Generated for each review cycle
- **KEY_PROJECT_FILES**: Status tracking throughout review process

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Feature Development**: Documentation assessment integrated with feature planning
- **Release Process**: Documentation review completion required before releases
- **Quality Gates**: Systematic documentation review as part of quality assurance

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Create Git Hook Templates**: Develop actual hook scripts for automation
2. **Document Integration**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md with commit message requirements
3. **Tool Development**: Build automation for assessment analysis and plan generation
4. **Team Training**: Establish understanding of documentation review cycle integration

**This systematic approach ensures that documentation quality evolves continuously with the codebase, using CF14's own methodology to maintain systematic improvement through each development cycle.**
