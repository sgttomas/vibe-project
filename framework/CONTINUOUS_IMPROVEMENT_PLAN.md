- Embeddings: Vector representation for similarity search
- Metadata: {
    domain: str,
    validation_score: float,
    usage_count: int,
    provenance: List[Operation],
    quality_metrics: Dict
  }
```

#### LLM as Semantic Triage Layer

- User experience pain points and technical accuracy issues
- Implementation status misalignments and cross-document inconsistencies

**Matrix B (Improvement Methodology)**:
- Selected systematic approach (4 Documents workflow, phased improvements, etc.)
- Specific analytical frameworks and improvement strategies
- Resource allocation and timeline constraints

#### Stage 2: Requirements Analysis (Semantic Multiplication A × B)
**Systematic Analysis Process**:
- Apply selected methodology to identified documentation problems
- Generate specific improvement requirements through structured evaluation

## Next Documentation Overhaul Instructions

**When the next git commit triggers a documentation overhaul following CF14 methodologies:**

1. **Extract Commit Context**: Use the git commit message explaining the reason and scope of changes as input for methodology selection

2. **Plan Transformation**: Convert this CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN into a new CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN that:
   - Incorporates the commit rationale as Matrix A (current state/problem)
   - Defines the appropriate improvement methodology as Matrix B  
   - Generates specific improvement requirements through systematic analysis
   - Establishes phased implementation approach with clear success criteria

3. **Execute Review Cycle**: Apply the new CONSOLIDATED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN to systematically review and update all KEY_PROJECT_FILES according to the defined methodology

4. **Status Tracking**: Update continuous improvement status throughout the process, maintaining the audit trail of systematic transformation

5. **Documentation Evolution**: Capture lessons learned and methodology refinements back into the CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN for future cycles

**This creates a self-improving documentation system that uses CF14's own methodology to systematically enhance itself through each major evolution cycle.**
